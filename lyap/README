Here there are the following programs:

- newtms
% this function performs the Newton loop for the
% multiple shooting solution of a periodic DE

- musstep
% this function sets up the multiple shooting matrix
% arising during Newton's method for periodic DEs
% It further solves the system for the Newton's correction
% and returns the transition matrices at the shooting points

- rk38
% this function takes one integration step with RK-38 rule
% of the differential equations to be solved to set up
% the multiple shooting matrix

- msfun
% this function sets up the vector field of the DE to be solved
% as well as the linearized vector field and the tau-derivative
% differential equation in a form suitable for the MS method

- vdp & Dvdp
% function and derivative (Jacobian) of the van der Pol problem

- monod
% this function gets the monodromy matrix
 

---- Typical use of these routines ----

We need to call only the routine "newtms" by specifying input parameters
(look at comments in this routine),  It is important to appreciate that
we are doing Newton's method, so convergence to the desired periodic
solution will occur ONLY if we start reasonably close.

Example script of use of routine:

f='vdp'; Df='Dvdp'; v0=[1;1]; % specified vector field and Jacobian, and phase vector
tol=1.e-8; maxit=10; % specified Newton's tolerance and max number of iterations
N=10; h=0.01; % specified number of MS intervals and integration stepsize
s=.... % here we need to specify initial guess, s is (2,N) vector
tau=...; % here we need to specfiy initial guess of period

[s,tau,YY,flag]=newtms(s,tau,N,h,v0,f,Df,tol,maxit); % call to routine
% for what it returns check documentation

M=monod(YY);  % returns monodromy
M=full(M); eig(M) % returns multipliers
